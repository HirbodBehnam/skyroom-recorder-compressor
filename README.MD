# Skyroom Recorder Compressor

A small GUI program I wrote to compress the skyroom recorded classes.

This program uses ffmpeg under the hood and uses these configs:

* h265 codec using libx265 and crf of 28
* Height of less than 720px
* Audio quality of less than 32kb/s and opus codec
* 10 frames per seconds

## Usage

At first install `ffmpeg` and `requirements.txt` dependencies using pip and then simply run `main.py` using python. I
developed this app with python3.10 not sure what is the minimum version of the app.

I recommend using a terminal to open the script because the logs will be logged to terminal.
